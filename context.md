# AI-Driven Tenant Lead Identification System

## Project Overview
This system autonomously identifies, qualifies, and facilitates outreach to businesses showing expansion or relocation signals by monitoring diverse data sources. It uses specialized agents for different source types and enhanced data processing capabilities.

## Architecture
The system employs a hybrid architecture combining:
- **CrewAI**: Source-specialized agent teams with domain expertise
- **LangGraph**: Workflow control and complex reasoning chains
- **ChromaDB**: Intelligent document storage and semantic retrieval
- **LlamaIndex**: Advanced document processing and PDF/image analysis
- **Instructor/Pydantic**: Structured data extraction with validation

## Key Components

### 1. Source-Specialized Signal Detection
- 13 dedicated agent teams for different expansion signal sources
- Optimized tools/prompts for each data source format
- Parallel monitoring with cross-source validation

### 2. Advanced Context Management
- Vector-based semantic memory with query expansion
- Token-optimized conversation history with summarization
- Document chunking and embedding with metadata enrichment

### 3. Multi-Step Signal Validation
- Cross-source signal correlation for improved confidence
- Temporal sequence analysis to identify patterns
- Geographic and industry-specific validation filters

### 4. Structured Data Extraction
- Pydantic model-based extraction with instructor
- Type validation and error handling for robust data capture
- Field-specific extraction prompts with clear definitions

### 5. Automated Outreach Orchestration
- Template-based communication with personalization
- CRM integration with automatic record updates
- Feedback-driven optimization of outreach strategies

## Implementation Details

### Source-Specific Agents
Each signal source has a dedicated agent team with specialized roles:
- Funding announcement monitors and analysts
- Press release and corporate communications monitors
- Job opening and hiring trend specialists
- Regulatory filing specialists
- Social media and news monitors

### Data Models
Structured Pydantic models for consistent data extraction:
- ExpansionSignal: Captures individual signals with source, confidence
- CompanyProfile: Basic company information
- ExpansionLead: Comprehensive lead combining signals and analysis

### Processing Flows
- Signal detection → Data extraction → Lead qualification → Prioritization → Outreach
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement based on conversion results

### Technology Stack
- Docker/Kubernetes for deployment and scaling
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching
- RabbitMQ for message queueing
- N8N for workflow automation
- Jaeger for monitoring and tracing
